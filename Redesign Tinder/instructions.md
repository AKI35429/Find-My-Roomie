OPEN TO ALL

It's redesign time! Redesign the app which you had installed with the hopes of finding someone who would redesign your lifeðŸ’–. We all know how it went though.

Anyways, swipe right to find your match.. ahem... I mean redesign the Tinder App, all the 5 screens of the app. To avoid any confusion in our relationshipðŸ˜Š, let me be clear , the 5 screens that need to be redesigned are : The main screen, Categories Screen, People who liked you screen, Messages screen and finally the profile screen. 

Since it is the beginning of a new phase of lifeâœ¨... app actually, so you can change the colour theme, the layout or anything else that you want! Free to express your love here. Love of designðŸ’ž, obviously!  

The redesign needs to be meaningful like relationshipsðŸ‘«, should be logical and rational like an ideal partnerðŸ˜Ž, should look and feel minimal and beautiful like true loveðŸ˜Œ and should obviously follow great UX and UI principles like a great designerðŸ¤£.

Submission Guideline:

Along with your true feelings, attach in the PR the figma link to your file in .txt file and place it *with careðŸ’“* in the **Redesign Tinder** Folder only.
